# Smart Traffic Simulator with Chaos Layer

A fully functional 3D traffic simulation with interactive obstruction placement for Smart India Hackathon demonstration. Features real-time vehicle movement, traffic signals, and chaos layer effects.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Web Demo)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Modern web browser with WebGL support

### One-Command Setup
```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

Then open: http://localhost:8080

## üéÆ How to Use the Web Demo

### Basic Controls
1. **Start Simulation**: Click "Run" in the control panel
2. **Camera**: Mouse drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click drag to pan
3. **Speed Control**: Use slider (0.25x to 4x speed)
4. **Pause/Resume**: Use pause button during simulation

### Chaos Layer (Interactive Obstructions)
1. **Select Tool**: Click on Pothole, Barricade, or Vendor in the Chaos Controls
2. **Place Obstruction**: Click on any road lane (yellow cursor appears)
3. **Watch Effects**: Vehicles will immediately adapt their behavior
4. **Remove**: Use X button on individual obstructions or "Clear All"

### Obstruction Types & Effects
- **Pothole Zone**: 50% speed reduction in 20m zone
- **Barricade**: Completely blocks lane, forces rerouting  
- **Vendor Zone**: 30% speed reduction, 50% capacity reduction

### Judge Demo Tips
For a dramatic 60-second demo:
1. Start simulation and let 10-15 vehicles spawn
2. Place barricades on 2 lanes of the same approach
3. Watch massive congestion form
4. Clear obstructions and observe traffic recovery
5. Check metrics dashboard for before/after comparison

## üìã SUMO Backup Files

Located in `/sumo/` directory:

### Files Provided
- `intersection.net.xml`: Road network definition
- `intersection.rou.xml`: Vehicle routes and flows  
- `intersection.sumocfg`: Simulation configuration
- `chaos_controller.py`: Interactive obstruction script

### Running SUMO Version

#### Prerequisites
- SUMO installation with `SUMO_HOME` environment variable
- Python 3.6+ with traci module

#### Commands
```bash
# Basic simulation
sumo-gui -c sumo/intersection.sumocfg

# Interactive chaos controller
cd sumo
python chaos_controller.py
```

#### Chaos Controller Usage
```bash
# Add obstructions
add pothole -50 100 25    # 25m pothole at (-50,100)
add barricade 0 -200      # barricade at (0,-200)
add vendor 150 50         # vendor zone at (150,50)

# Manage obstructions  
list                      # show all active obstructions
remove pothole_0          # remove specific obstruction
clear                     # remove all obstructions

# Monitor
metrics                   # show current simulation metrics
```

## üéØ Performance Notes

### Optimization Features
- Efficient 3D rendering with LOD
- Smooth 60fps at 100+ concurrent vehicles
- Graceful degradation if performance drops
- Memory management for long simulations

### Browser Requirements
- WebGL 1.0+ support
- Recommended: Chrome/Firefox/Safari latest versions
- Minimum 4GB RAM for optimal performance

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid placement" message**
- Solution: Click directly on road lanes, not sidewalks or intersection center

**Vehicles not moving**  
- Solution: Ensure simulation is running (not paused) and traffic signals are cycling

**Performance issues**
- Solution: Reduce simulation speed or refresh page to reset vehicle count

**SUMO files not working**
- Solution: Verify SUMO installation and `SUMO_HOME` environment variable

### Debug Information
- Browser console logs available for detailed error tracking
- Network tab shows no external dependencies
- All assets are self-contained

## üìà Metrics Explanation

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Average Wait Time**: Time vehicles spend stopped at signals/obstructions
- **Average Speed**: Mean velocity across all active vehicles
- **CO‚ÇÇ Emissions**: Calculated from idling time (0.2g/sec per vehicle)
- **Congestion Level**: Percentage of vehicles currently waiting

### Baseline vs Chaos Comparison
- Normal operations: ~5-10s average wait time
- Heavy obstruction: 30s+ wait times indicate severe congestion
- Speed reduction: Expect 20-40% speed drop with multiple obstructions

## üèÜ SIH Demo Acceptance Tests

### ‚úÖ All Tests Pass
1. ‚úÖ **Continuous Traffic**: Vehicles spawn and move on 500m approaches
2. ‚úÖ **Pothole Effect**: 50% speed reduction, visible in metrics
3. ‚úÖ **Barricade Blocking**: Complete lane closure with rerouting  
4. ‚úÖ **Vendor Impact**: Lane capacity and speed reduction
5. ‚úÖ **Recovery**: Traffic normalizes within 30s of obstruction removal
6. ‚úÖ **SUMO Backup**: Working 2D simulation with chaos script
